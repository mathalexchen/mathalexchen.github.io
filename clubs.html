Cards are worth certain numbers of<br> points.<br> Twist #1-Throwing Clubs: The notion of following suit is altered, but not<br> eliminated. You must play either the suit that was led, or a club, unless<br> you are out of both. A player who leads in clubs may declare another suit<br> (meaning that others must play either that suit or a club unless out of both), or may<br> declare clubs alone.<br> Taking Tricks: Clubs are, in fact, a semi-trump suit. Only clubs and the<br> suit which was led are eligible to win a trick. Each club is ranked slightly<br> higher than the corresponding card of another suit. For example, if diamonds are<br> led, the seven of clubs beats the seven of diamonds but not the eight of<br> diamonds.<br> Start: Deal out the deck. If there are 3 players, leave the last card face<br> down on the table. The two of clubs leads off (unless nobody has it since it&#8217;s in<br> the middle, in which case the 3 of clubs leads). If there were three<br> players, then the player who takes the final trick takes the extra card.<br> Scoring: At the end of the hand, tally the cards in the tricks you&#8217;ve taken<br> as follows: First, give yourself -1 for each card you have. Give yourself back<br> +3 for every club you have except for the Jack of clubs; instead, tally an<br> additional -10 for the Jack of clubs. This final tally is your score for the<br> round, unless...<br> Twist #2-Scrambling: If one player&#8217;s tally is -26 or worse, then everyone<br> recounts their score for the hand by a new formula. There is now no per-card<br> penalty; each club is worth -3 except for the Jack of clubs, which is worth<br> + 10. This rule exists to further complicate the strategy, and to make it<br> possible not to get screwed too badly by a terrible hand.<br> <br> <a href="index.html">Back</a><br> </body> </html>
